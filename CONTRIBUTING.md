# Contributing to kmod

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to kmod!

If you want to submit changes, you can submit GitHub [pull requests] as well as
patches sent to the [mailing list]. In addition you can open issues and feature
requests on our [GitHub tracker].

## Commits

The kmod project uses a [linear, "recipe" style] history. This means that
commits should be small, digestible, stand-alone, and functional.

Commit messages are in imperative mood and merges are to be avoided.

When in doubt, or need a regresher, checking through the output of `git log` is
highly recommended.

## Commit tags

Commit messages, apart from stating why a particular change is made, can include
a range of tags.

### Issues, feature requests

Whenever a patch resolves a particular issue, be that one on our [GitHub
tracker] or elsewhere, use the `Closes:` tag followed by the full URL.

    Closes: https://github.com/kmod-project/kmod/issues/65

### Discussions, references

If your commit covers a topic raised in an issue, but no the issue itself, or
otherwise refers to a more complicated topic, you can use `Reference:`

### Bugfixes, regressions

Nobody is perfect and regressions happen from time to time. Whenever a commit
addresses a regression caused by another commit, use `Fixes:` as below:

    Fixes: 38943b2 ("shared: use size_t for strbuf")

## Coding style

The project uses style practically identical to the kernel style. You can see
the in-tree [CODING-STYLE file](CODING-STYLE) for quick references.

We also have a [.clang-format file](.clang-format) to ease and enforce the
style. Make sure you run git-clang-format against your changes, before
submitting PRs/patches.

## Documentation

The official libkmod documentation is generated by [gtk-doc] and a simple test
is wired to `meson test` to catch accidental mistakes or omissions.

If you're unfamiliar with gtk-doc here is a [quick primer].

## Manual pages

Our manual pages are written in [scdoc] a simple [markdown-like syntax]. Please
make sure to update them as you add new options to the kmod tools.

## Shell completions

The project aims to provide bash, zsh and fish shell completions for all the
kmod tools. Currently support is borderline non-existent, so your help is
greatly appreciated.
