kmod - Linux kernel module handling

OVERVIEW
========

kmod is a set of tools to handle common tasks with Linux kernel modules like
insert, remove, list, check properties, resolve dependencies and aliases.

These tools are designed on top of libkmod, a library that is shipped with
kmod. See libkmod/README for more details on this library and how to use it.
The aim is to be compatible with tools, configurations and indexes from
module-init-tools project.
