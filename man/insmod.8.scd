INSMOD(8) "kmod" "insmod"

# NAME

insmod - Simple program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel

# SYNOPSIS

*insmod* [_OPTIONS_] [_filename_] [_moduleÂ options_...]

# DESCRIPTION

*insmod* is a trivial program to insert a module into the kernel. Most users
will want to use* modprobe*(8) instead, which is more clever and can handle
module dependencies.

Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the work of trying to
link the module is now done inside the kernel, the *dmesg*(1) usually gives more
information about errors.

# OPTIONS

*-f*
*--force*
	This option can be extremely dangerous: it tells the kernel to ignore
	the module version and vermagic fields when loading. With this option,
	you can load modules build locally or by third parties, although this
	can lead to memory corruption, system crashes and data loss.
*-s*
*--syslog*
	Send errors to syslog instead of standard error.

*-v*
*--verbose*
	Print messages about what the program is doing. Usually *insmod* prints
	messages only if something goes wrong.

*-V*
*--version*
	Show version of program and exit.

*-h*
*--help*
	Print the help message and exit.
