MODULES.DEP(5) "kmod" "modules.dep"

# NAME

modules.dep, modules.dep.bin - Module dependency information

# SYNOPSIS

@MODULE_DIRECTORY@/modules.dep

@MODULE_DIRECTORY@/modules.dep.bin

# DESCRIPTION

*modules.dep.bin* is a binary file generated by *depmod* listing the
dependencies for every module in the directories under
@MODULE_DIRECTORY@/_version_. It is used by *kmod* tools such as *modprobe* and
libkmod.

Its text counterpart is located in the same directory with the name
*modules.dep*. The text version is maintained only for ease of reading by humans
and is in no way used by any *kmod* tool.

These files are not intended for editing or use by any additional utilities as
their format is subject to change in the future. You should use the *modinfo*(8)
command to obtain information about modules in a future proof and compatible
fashion rather than touching these files.
